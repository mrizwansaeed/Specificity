If all other parameters are kept fixed, a high number of entities can lead to poor results for precision and recall. The reason is that more entities require more samples so that and hence parameters in line 5 in Algorithm 1 (in the paper) need to be adjusted accordingly. If there are k representative properties, then N_paths should be chosen as k|S|.
