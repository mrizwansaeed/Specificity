If all other parameters are kept fixed, a high number of entities can lead to poor results for precision and recall. The reason is that mores entities require parameters of line 5 in Algorithm 1 (in the paper) to be adjusted accordingly. If N_paths/|S| is very small, that will lead to poor selection of representative semantic relationships.
