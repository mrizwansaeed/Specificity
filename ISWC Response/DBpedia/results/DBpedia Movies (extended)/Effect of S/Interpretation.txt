If all other parameters are kept fixed, a high number of entities can lead to poor results for precision and recall. The reason is that more entities require more samples in order to have a representative selection of semantic properties in line 5 in Algorithm 1 (in the paper). Say, if there are k representative properties, then N_paths should be at leaast k|S|.
